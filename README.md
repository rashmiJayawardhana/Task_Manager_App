# Task Manager Web Application

Welcome to the **Task Manager Web Application**! This is a full-stack application built with **Angular** for the frontend, **Spring Boot** for the backend, and **MySQL** as the database. The app allows users to manage tasks (create, view, edit, and delete) and includes advanced features like JWT-based authentication and Docker deployment.

## üìã Project Overview

The Task Manager app provides a user-friendly interface for employees to manage tasks within an organization. It includes an Employee module with a detailed Task Details page where employees can:

- View task details by task ID.
- See comments posted on a task by task ID.
- Post new comments on tasks.

The application is built with a modern tech stack and follows best practices for modularity, scalability, and security.
